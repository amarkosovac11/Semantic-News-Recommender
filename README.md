# Semantic News Recommender

## Description

The Semantic News Recommender is an intelligent search application designed to improve the way users discover news articles. Unlike traditional keyword-based search engines, it leverages semantic search powered by natural language processing to understand the meaning behind user queries. Using pre-trained Sentence Transformer models, the system converts news articles and queries into vector embeddings that capture their contextual meaning.

These embeddings are stored and searched efficiently using Pinecone, a cloud-based vector database optimized for similarity search. The application features a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, enabling users to quickly find news articles relevant to their interests, even when their search terms differ from the article text.

This project demonstrates the power of combining modern NLP techniques and vector search to create smarter, more accurate search experiences.
